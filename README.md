# wirbelsturm-rpm-avro-c

Builds an RPM based on an official [Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org) release, using
[fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).

Unfortunately the official Avro project does not release ready-to-use RPM packages.  The RPM
script in this repository closes that gap.

The RPM created with this code is used by [Wirbelsturm](https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm).

# Bootstrapping

After a fresh checkout of this git repo you should first bootstrap the code.

    $ ./bootstrap

Basically, the bootstrapping will ensure that you have a suitable [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) setup.
If you already have `fpm` installed and configured you may try skipping the bootstrapping step.


<a name="supported-os"></a>

# Supported operating systems

## OS of the build server

It is recommended to run the RPM script [avro-c-rpm.sh](avro-c-rpm.sh) on a RHEL OS family machine.


## Target operating systems

The RPM files are built for the following operating system and architecture:

* RHEL 6 OS family (e.g. RHEL 6, CentOS 6, Amazon Linux), 64 bit

# Usage


<a name="build"></a>

## Building the RPM

Syntax:

    $ ./avro-c-rpm.sh <avro-c-tarball-download-url>

To find a direct download URL visit the [Avro downloads](http://avro.apache.org/releases.html#Download) page and click
on the link to an Avro release.  Note: Do not use the (mirror) link on the download page because that link will
first take you to one of the Apache mirror sites.  Use one of the direct links.

Example:

    $ ./avro-c-rpm.sh http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/avro/avro-1.7.6/c/avro-c-1.7.6.tar.gz

    >>> Will create avro-c-1.7.6.el6.x86_64.rpm

This will create an RPM that contains all Avro files and directories under the directory path `/usr`.


<a name="verify"></a>

## Verify the RPM

You can verify the proper creation of the RPM file with:

    $ rpm -qpi avro-c-*.rpm    # show package info
    $ rpm -qpR avro-c-*.rpm    # show package dependencies
    $ rpm -qpl avro-c-*.rpm    # show contents of package


<a name="configuration"></a>

## Custom configuration

You can modify [avro-c-rpm.sh](avro-c-rpm.sh) directly to modify the way the RPM is packaged.  For instance, you can
change the root level directory to something other than `/usr`, or modify the name of the package maintainer.
